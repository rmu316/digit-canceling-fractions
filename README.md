# digit-canceling-fractions

#About
program which computes all such fractions such that given the two digits of the numerator and denominator, if one digit from each of them are cancelled, the resulting fraction would equal the original fraction. Example: 49/98, after cancelling the 9's, we get 4/8 = 1/2 = 49/98

#Usage
Type "make" in a Unix cmd line to build the code
Type "./digit_cancel" to run it
